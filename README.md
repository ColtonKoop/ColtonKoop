Engineering Physicist turned SoC Logic Design Engineer at Intel. I enjoy working on hardware systems from digital design to electronics, and I like the intersection of theory and implementation. I try to contribute to the teams and communities around me and keep learning from the people I work with.

### Focus:
- Digital design: micro-architecture and RTL in Verilog/SystemVerilog
- Physics meets hardware: optics, rockets, and high-frequency systems
- Lab infrastructure, tooling, and workflows, often with Python automation
- Physical builds: 3D modeling/printing, electronics, and PCB design

### Why GitHub?
This profile is my lab notebook for side projects, experiments, and tools that explore hardware systems.
