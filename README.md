### 👋 About

I’m a **hardware systems engineer** with a background in **Engineering Physics** and a focus on **SoC logic design**.  
I enjoy building reliable, well-structured hardware — from clean RTL and micro-architectures to physical systems that blend electronics, mechanics, and design.

---

### 🛠 Focus Areas

- **Digital Hardware** — Verilog / SystemVerilog, RTL design, micro-architecture
- **Hardware Prototyping** — FPGA workflows, PCB design, lab bring-up
- **Physical Builds** — 3D modeling & printing, power electronics, instrumentation

---

### 🔬 Side Projects

I enjoy technical side projects that explore **how theory becomes real hardware**, including:
- FPGA development environments inspired by ASIC workflows
- Physics-driven art & engineering builds

(Selected projects are pinned below 👇)
